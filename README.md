This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

This project is my attempt at Udacity's React-Rudux course. We'll see how it goes.

Installation is pretty simple:

    Fork or clone me (this repo)
    npm install from the root
    You will need to grab the backend server by cloning or forking https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter you will also need to npm install that from the root directory
    Startup the backend server (yarn start) and it will run on port 3001
    Start this web app for writing and commenting on port 3000 by issuing yarn start from the root

Credits:

I lifted a bunch of CSS styles from this site:
https://www.sanwebe.com/2014/08/css-html-forms-designs

The UUID generator code I grabbed from Stack Overflow. Its kinda overkill for this project. 

Have fun!
